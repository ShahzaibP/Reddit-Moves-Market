# Reddit-Moves-Market

This was a weekend project of basic data sceince. I use a dataset containing 8 years worth of reddit posts with top 25 headlines for every single date. The movements for the stock markets was shown by 1 when DJIA Adj Close value rose or stayed as the same and 0 when DJIA Adj Close value decreased. I use NLP techniques to process data and then use a MLP to see how news interacts with stock market movements. The accuracy I got was a modest 57%.
