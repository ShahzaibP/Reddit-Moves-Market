# Reddit-Moves-Market

This was a weekend project of data sceince. I use a dataset containing 8 years worth of reddit posts with top 25 headlines for every single date and the direction of overall movement of the stockmarket that day. The movements for the stock markets was shown by 1 when DJIA value rose or stayed as the same and 0 when DJIA value decreased. I use NLP techniques to process the news and then use a MLP to see how the news interacts with stock market movements.
